              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Order Cancellation</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Orders can be cancelled within 24 hours of placement without any charges. After cutting has commenced, cancellation will incur a 25% charge of the total order value to cover material and labor costs.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Refund Policy</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Refunds are processed within 7-10 business days of approved cancellation. Custom-made garments that have been cut or partially completed are non-refundable unless there is a manufacturing defect on our part.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Design Modifications</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Minor design changes can be accommodated before cutting begins at no additional cost. Major modifications after cutting will be treated as a new order and charged accordingly.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Emergency Cancellations</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                In case of genuine emergencies (medical, family), we may waive cancellation charges on a case-by-case basis. Documentation may be required for verification.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Unclaimed Orders</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Completed orders not collected within 30 days will incur storage charges of â‚¹50 per day. Orders unclaimed for 90 days will be considered abandoned, and no refund will be provided.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Quality Issues</h2>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                If you're unsatisfied with the quality of workmanship, please notify us within 7 days of delivery. We will assess the issue and provide appropriate remedies, including rework or partial refunds.
              </p>
